# 06.-Menu-Slider-Modal-DOM-CSS
This project is a simple landing page with a responsive navigation sidebar and a modal popup for signing up. The page is styled using CSS and includes a bit of JavaScript to handle the interactive features.

## Overview
This landing page project demonstrates the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a responsive and interactive web page. It features a sidebar navigation menu, a call-to-action button, and a modal form for user registration. The page is designed to be visually appealing and easy to use, with smooth transitions and clear call-to-action elements.

## Features
- Responsive navigation sidebar that can be toggled open and closed.
- A modal popup form for user sign-up.
- Styled with CSS and enhanced with Font Awesome icons.

## Setup and Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name

2. **Open index.html in Your Browser**
   You can simply open the index.html file in your browser to see the landing page in action.

## How It Works
**Toggling the Navigation Sidebar** 
- The navigation sidebar is toggled using JavaScript. When the toggle button is clicked, the show-nav class is added or removed from the body element, which shifts the page content to the right, revealing the sidebar.

**Showing and Hiding the Modal**
- The modal is shown when the "Sign Up" button is clicked, and hidden when the close button or any area outside the modal is clicked. This is handled by adding and removing the show-modal class to the modal container.
